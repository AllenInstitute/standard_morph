"""Built-in suite definitions and suite composition helpers.

A suite is a named, ordered list of metric names. The two built-in suites map
to the two coordinate spaces: run ``default_pre_registration_tests`` on
``image_space`` reconstructions and ``default_post_registration_tests`` on
``ccf_registered`` reconstructions. Applicability is still enforced per-metric
by the engine, so a mismatched suite/space combination fails fast rather than
silently skipping.

The two suites share a single base list of **space-agnostic** morphology
checks -- everything that is meaningful regardless of coordinate space -- and the
post-registration suite simply appends the **CCF-only** checks (which require the
data to be registered to the atlas). Defining them this way keeps the two suites
from drifting apart: the *only* difference is the CCF metrics.

Note: the always-run input-integrity checks (``required_columns``, ...,
``acyclic``) are not listed here -- the engine runs them every time regardless of
suite. Resource-driven, opt-in metrics (``filename_format``,
``parent_before_child``, ``soma_at_centroid``) are likewise omitted; request them
explicitly via ``metrics=[...]`` when their inputs are available.
